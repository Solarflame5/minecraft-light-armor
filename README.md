# Solarflame's light armor
A resource pack made by me inspired by [Dresdom](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dresdom/)'s [light armor pack](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/7e8zqv/i_made_a_light_armor_resource_pack/), using the original Minecraft textures as a base.

This pack aims to fix the problem where the default armor textures almost completely cover player skins, which is quite unpleasant when playing multiplayer. 

Chainmail armor is unchanged as its already see-through and leather armor is unchanged because a lot of multiplayer minigames use it for purposes like distinguishing different teams.

Both Dresdom's original pack and my remake with modern textures are available in this repository. Dresdom's pack does not include netherite textures and I don't plan to add them for now.

The pack format is set to `12` in the `pack.mcmeta` of both packs to make them compatible with 1.19.3. This will cause all older Minecraft versions to show a "This pack is incompatible" message, you can safely ignore this warning and use the pack on any minecraft version between 1.8-1.19.3.
